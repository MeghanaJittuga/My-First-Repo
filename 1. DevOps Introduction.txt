1. DevOps Introduction
What is DevOps?
DevOps + Development + Operations
It's culture +set of practices +tools that help:
* Developers(Who write code)
* Operations (Who deploy/ manage systems)
--> work together, instead of working in silos.
Real- time Example:
Imagine you're building a mobile app like Swiggy.
* The developer writes code to add "Track My Order" Feature
*without DevOps: Developer gives code to Ops team --> they manually deploy --> bugs happen --> delays.
*with DevOps:
Code is automatically tested and deployed --> customers get updates faster and safely.


DevOps Helps You:
* Release features faster(like adding new payment methods in Zomato)
* Fix bugs quickly(like fixing login issue in IRCTC)
* Automate respective tasks(like server restarts, database backups) 

DevOps Lifecycle

~ The 8 phases of DevOps Lifecycle: 

Plan     Define what to build                     swiggy decides to add a "Dark Mode Feature
Develop  write the code                           developers write java / kotlin code for UI  
Build    compile code into deployable format      Android APK is built automatically
Test     Check for bugs automatically             
Release  Approve the build for deployment         QA signs odd the build
Deploy   Push app to serves or app store          APK is uploaded to play store
Operate  keep app running, fix any issues         Monitor if app is crashing
Monitor  Analyze performance and feedback         Fire base  or new relic shows App metrics

~ Cycle contiinues: Feedback from users --> back to plan


3. GitHub Basics:

what is Git & GitHub?
  *Git= Version control System(local)
  *GitHub = Online Platform to store  Git Projects

* Real- Life Analogy:
